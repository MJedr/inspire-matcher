The bounds highlight a relation between the existence of incongruent ground states and the absence of edge disorder chaos. In particular, it suggests that the presence of disorder chaos is necessary for the variance to be of order less than the volume. In addition, a relation is established between the scale of disorder chaos and the size of critical droplets. The results imply a long-conjectured relation between the droplet theory of Fisher and Huse and the absence of incongruence."
