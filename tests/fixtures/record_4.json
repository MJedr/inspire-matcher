      "value":"The inner structure of neutron star is considered from theoretical point of view and is compared with the observed data. We have proposed a form of an equation of state relating pressure with matter density which indicates the stiff equation of state of neutron stars. From our study we have calculated mass(M), compactness(u) and surface red-shift(Zs ) for the neutron stars namely PSR J1614-2230, PSR J1903+327, Cen X-3, SMC X-1, Vela X-1, Her X-1 and compared with the recent observational data. We have also indicated the possible radii of the different stars which needs further study. Finally we have examined the stability for such type of theoretical structure."
