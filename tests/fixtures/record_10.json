As a result, downstream of a charged impurity in the presence of a uniform supersonic electric current flow, a wake pattern of induced charge density and potential is formed whose geometry is controlled by the Mach number $M$. For $1\\sqrt{2}$. These wakes also trail an external charge traveling supersonically a fixed distance away from the electron gas."
